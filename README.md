An AI-powered vehicle damage inspection system that automatically analyzes vehicle images, detects visible damage, and estimates repair recommendations using a hybrid Spring Boot + FastAPI architecture.

## 📌 Overview

Vehicle Inspector is a full-stack backend project designed to automate vehicle damage assessment.

The system allows users to:

- Register and authenticate securely using JWT
- Manage their vehicles
- Upload vehicle damage images
- Analyze images with an AI service
- Detect damage type and severity
- Identify the damaged vehicle part
- Recommend repair actions
- Store inspection history for future reference

Unlike traditional AI-only solutions, repair cost calculation is handled by the backend using business rules and database-driven pricing, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

 Repair Prices              Damage Detection
 Inspection History         Classification
```

The project follows a microservice-style architecture:

- **Spring Boot** handles authentication, business logic, data persistence and pricing.
- **FastAPI** performs AI-based image analysis.
- **PostgreSQL** stores application data.

# 🤖 AI Output

The AI service returns:

- Damage Type
- Damage Severity
- Vehicle Part
- Recommended Repair Action
- Replacement Requirement
- Confidence Score
- Analysis Message

Example:

```json
{
  "damageType": "SCRATCH",
  "damageSeverity": "MINOR",
  "vehiclePart": "FRONT_BUMPER",
  "recommendedAction": "POLISHING",
  "partReplacementRequired": false,
  "confidenceScore": 0.91,
  "analysisMessage": "Minor scratch detected on the front bumper."
}
```
